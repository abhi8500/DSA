         * The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that
         * provides a simple interface to a complex system.
         * It hides the complexities of subsystems and provides a unified API for clients to interact with.
         * When to Use the Facade Pattern?
         * .When you want to simplify interaction with a complex system.
         * .When you need to decouple clients from multiple subsystem classes.
         * .When you want to improve maintainability by reducing dependencies.
