/**
 *  The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern that is used to
 *  reduce memory usage when a large number of similar objects are created.
 *  Instead of creating duplicate objects, it shares existing instances to save resources.
 *  <b>When to Use Flyweight Pattern?</b>
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>When you have a large number of objects consuming a lot of memory.</li>
 *      <li>When many objects share common state (intrinsic state).</li>
 *      <li>When you need to improve performance and efficiency.</li>
 *  </ul>
 *  <b>Concepts in Flyweight Pattern</b>
 *  <ul>
 *      <li><b>Intrinsic State: </b> Shared among multiple objects (e.g., shape, color).</li>
 *      <li> <b> Extrinsic State:  </b> Unique to each object (e.g., coordinates, position).</li>
 *  </ul>
